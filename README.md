# Hardware-Assignment-1

This is a project in Unity that is built to show a proof of concept for a racing game styled after Super Mario Kart SNES using a custom controller made with an Arduino.

The members of the group that made the project are:
Ilya Soukoreff			(Student ID# 100927688)
Owen Lewis-Hanslip		(Student ID# 100912741)
Alex Bean			(Student ID# 100927087)

This project was made in Unity Game Engine with simple code to simulate an input from a few buttons, and in TinkerCAD to simulate the Arduino and all our hardware.

It was made this way as per the guidelines of the assignment, and due to time constrains. Initially we were going to have a physical Arduino working with it but we couldn’t get it working withing the time limit so we pivoted to simulating everything.

For who did what in the group:
Alex did the hardware simulation and part of the code in the simulated Arduino.
Owen set up the scene in Unity as well as did part of the code in the game engine.
Ilya finished the code in the Arduino and in Unity, and made all the submission materials (screenshots, videos, etc.).
